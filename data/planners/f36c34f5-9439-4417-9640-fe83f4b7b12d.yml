description: |
  The buckets planner is a variant of the batch planner that makes use of the new bucket features within Caldera.
  Each of the abilities within caldera are sorted into buckets based on their corresponding tactics in ATT&CK by
  default, with the option of non-default mappings remaining possible. This planner simply loops through all
  abilities available to the provided adversary, in the order of tactics provided in the ATT&CK matrix, looping if
  more things can be done.
