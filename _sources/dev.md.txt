# Developers

There are multiple ways to run the **arsenal** plugin within **caldera**. The recommended way is mounting the plugin as a *volume* in a Docker container, which allows for active development and modification of the plugin without restarting the CALDERA server.

*Alternative deployment requires re-starting the `caldera` server when changes to the plugin are made.*

## Recommended Installation and Quick Start
Navigate to the [`caldera-atlas`](https://github.com/mitre-atlas/caldera-atlas) repository and follow steps for installing the required repos for development, or use the quick start script.
