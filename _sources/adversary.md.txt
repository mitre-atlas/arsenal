# Adversary: Arsenal

The adversary and victim relationship used in Arsenal with CALDERA can be used in many different ways:
- Red Teaming effort
- Blue Teaming effort
- Forensic analysis of ML algorithms and subsequent software underlying the algorithm

This plugin focuses on using **both** traditional cybersecurity TTPs with modern ML TTPs to attack a hosted victim system. It is our collected understanding that ML algorithms are rarely stand-alone, and adversaries in-the-wild will use traditional cybersecurity attacks alongside ML attacks in order to achieve their goals. 

**Arsenal** has been developed for the Cybersecurity Engineer/Researcher, but will also benefit ML/MLOps Engineers in better understanding the entire end-to-end software stack that ML is deployed into.

This plugin is not designed for creating new adversarial attacks/defenses, but as a way to red-team or blue-team your current operational models against a myriad of cybersecurity and ML vulnerabilities described in [`MITRE ATT&CK`](https://attack.mitre.org/) and [`MITRE ATLAS`](https://atlas.mitre.org/).
